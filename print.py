# "print" key word prints 


print ("Hello World") # basic syntax for print

#KEY POINTS TO NOTE DOWN
    # python is case sensitive ("print" is not equal to "Print")
    # "#" symbol uses for writing comments in your codes.
    # it will not affect you code
    # you can use single quatation marks rather than using double qutation
